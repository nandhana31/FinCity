    { keywords: ["stability score", "overall stability"], answer: "Your overall city stability score represents the combined health of your Investments, Spending, and Savings segments. A higher score means your finances are managed more safely." },
    { keywords: ["improve investments", "investment district"], answer: "To improve your Investments District, diversify your portfolio and reduce exposure to volatile assets by staying updated on market trends using the 'Check Risk' feature." },
    { keywords: ["tech stocks", "tech risk"], answer: "Tech stocks can be volatile due to rapid industry changes and market sentiment. Balancing them with more stable investments can help reduce your risk." },
    { keywords: ["optimize spending", "spending"], answer: "Optimizing spending means cutting unnecessary expenses (like unused subscriptions detected by the app) and using the earned Blueprints to upgrade your Spending Hub." },
    { keywords: ["innovation blueprint", "blueprint", "earn blueprints"], answer: "Innovation Blueprints are rewards earned for smart financial actions like logging savings or optimizing spending when an opportunity arises. Use them to upgrade your city districts!" },
    { keywords: ["diversification", "diversify"], answer: "Diversification means spreading your investments across various asset classes (stocks, REITs, etc.) to minimize the impact of any single investment's poor performance." },
    { keywords: ["high spending", "spending too high"], answer: "High spending can be simulated here, but in a full version, the app would analyze transactions. Reduce recurring expenses to improve your Spending Health score." },
    { keywords: ["risk ticker", "alerts"], answer: "Use the 'Check Risk' feature with a stock or REIT ticker. The app analyzes news sentiment via Alpha Vantage to provide alerts on potential risks affecting your Investment District." },
    { keywords: ["reduce risk", "lower risk"], answer: "To reduce investment risk, use the 'Check Risk' tool regularly, consider diversifying (add different tickers!), and potentially upgrade your Investment District with Blueprints." },
    { keywords: ["emergency fund", "emergency"], answer: "An emergency fund (represented by upgrading your Savings District) acts as a safety net for unexpected expenses, boosting stability." },
    { keywords: ["budget", "plan"], answer: "Budgeting involves planning income and expenses. While not fully implemented here, optimizing spending reflects good budgeting." },
    { keywords: ["high risk", "risk score"], answer: "A low Investment Risk score (or a red/orange district) indicates vulnerability. Analyze the alerts and consider diversifying or adjusting your holdings." },
    { keywords: ["monitor market", "market sentiment"], answer: "Use the 'Check Risk' button. It fetches real-time news sentiment data from Alpha Vantage to help you monitor the market's mood towards your investments." }, // <-- Your query should match this
    { keywords: ["optimize spending benefits", "benefits of optimizing spending"], answer: "Optimizing spending improves your Spending score, Overall Stability, and earns Blueprints for city upgrades â€“ a win-win!" },
    { keywords: ["financial literacy", "improve financial literacy"], answer: "FinCity Architect helps you learn by doing! Seeing how actions affect your city, reading tips, and understanding risk alerts improves your financial know-how." },
    { keywords: ["upgrade", "city development"], answer: "You can upgrade your Investment, Spending, or Savings districts using Blueprints earned from positive actions. Upgrades improve the base score and visual look of the district!"},
    { keywords: ["how it works", "what does this app do"], answer: "FinCity Architect gamifies finance! Check investment risks (CBRE focus), simulate optimizing spending/savings based on insights (Capital One focus), earn Blueprints, and upgrade your virtual city reflecting your financial health." },
    { keywords: ["hello", "hi", "help"], answer: "Hello! I'm FinBot. Ask me about your city scores, districts, blueprints, risks, or general financial concepts like budgeting or diversification."}
